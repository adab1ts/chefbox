# Chefbox

Coderebels chef workstation repository.  
Forked from [opscode/chef-repo](https://github.com/opscode/chef-repo)


## Repository Directories

This repository contains several directories, and each directory contains a README file that describes what it is for in greater detail, and how to use it for managing your systems with Chef.

* `.chef-skel/`   - Contains certificates, config and env files to setup new chef server environments.
* `bootstrap/`    - Contains config files and scripts to be delivered to new chefbox nodes before bootstrapping.
* `certificates/` - SSL certificates generated by `rake ssl_cert` live here.
* `config/`       - Contains the Rake configuration file, `rake.rb`.
* `cookbooks/`    - Cookbooks you download or create.
* `data_bags/`    - Store data bags and items in .json in the repository.
* `roles/`        - Store roles in .rb or .json in the repository.
* `tasks/`        - Include rake tasks to ease converging of new chefbox nodes.


## Rake Tasks

The repository contains a `Rakefile` that includes tasks that are installed with the Chef libraries. To view the tasks available with in the repository with a brief description, run `rake -T`.

The default task (`default`) is run when executing `rake` with no arguments. It will call the task `test_cookbooks`.

The following tasks are not directly replaced by knife sub-commands.

* `bundle_cookbook[cookbook]` - Creates cookbook tarballs in the `pkgs/` dir.
* `install`                   - Calls `update`, `roles` and `upload_cookbooks` Rake tasks.
* `ssl_cert`                  - Create self-signed SSL certificates in `certificates/` dir.
* `update`                    - Update the repository from source control server, understands git and svn.

The following tasks duplicate functionality from knife and may be removed in a future version of Chef.

* `metadata`                  - replaced by `knife cookbook metadata -a`.
* `new_cookbook`              - replaced by `knife cookbook create`.
* `role[role_name]`           - replaced by `knife role from file`.
* `roles`                     - iterates over the roles and uploads with `knife role from file`.
* `test_cookbooks`            - replaced by `knife cookbook test -a`.
* `test_cookbook[cookbook]`   - replaced by `knife cookbook test COOKBOOK`.
* `upload_cookbooks`          - replaced by `knife cookbook upload -a`.
* `upload_cookbook[cookbook]` - replaced by `knife cookbook upload COOKBOOK`.

## Configuration

The repository uses two configuration files.

* config/rake.rb
* .chef/knife.rb

The first, `config/rake.rb` configures the Rakefile in two sections.

* Constants used in the `ssl_cert` task for creating the certificates.
* Constants that set the directory locations used in various tasks.

If you use the `ssl_cert` task, change the values in the `config/rake.rb` file appropriately. These values were also used in the `new_cookbook` task, but that task is replaced by the `knife cookbook create` command which can be configured below.

The second config file, `.chef/knife.rb` is a repository specific configuration file for knife. If you're using the Opscode Platform, you can download one for your organization from the management console. If you're using the Open Source Chef Server, you can generate a new one with `knife configure`. For more information about configuring Knife, see the [Knife documentation](http://docs.chef.io/knife.html).


## Environment

Some rake tasks expect the following ENV variables to be set

* `XEDITOR` - Preferred text editor

Define and export them in the proper config file (ie. $HOME/.bashrc, $HOME/.zshrc, ...)
