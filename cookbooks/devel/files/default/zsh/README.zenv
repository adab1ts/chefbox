# This is the folder where you should place your env files.
# Just touch your new env file, name it after the application you are defining the env for,
# and give it an 'zenv' extension to ease identifying its contents.
#
# Here you are an example of env file content:
#
# # vim:ft=zsh
# # File: $DOTFILES_PATH/zsh/env.d/chefbox.zenv
# # Contents: Chefbox Env Variables
#
# export PATH="/opt/chef/embedded/bin:${PATH}"
